# sequence-counter
Heavily commented, quick script for processing sequence files for length and basepair composition

This is a pure bash script for taking a sequnce file and determining its base content, total length both gapped and ungapped. 
The purpose of the script is to be a portable educational tool for people just learning bash scripting (such as myself)

It's not the best optimized script by any stretch of imagination, but it's simple enough that all its components should be useful for any amateur researcher looking for simple, practical code examples. 

For reference, on a netbook with Celeron N3060 processor and 4GB of ram running Lubuntu 20.04
Human chromosome 1 GRCh38.p13 (about 240.8 MB file) NC_000001.11 takes below time from start to finish.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GCF_900045375.1 takes below time from start to finish

The repo contains a 100bp positive control fasta file generated by a DNA synthesis script from https://github.com/naturepoker/dna-synth
Running ./seq_counter.sh control_100bp.fasta should output below result.
